### Fully Customizable Order Sets
Imaging centers can fully customize order sets, defining available healthcare resources, specific naming conventions, and self-scheduling capabilities tailored to their individual practice needs.

### Convenient Organization Auto-Fill
If a patient has previously booked an appointment, the relevant organization details will now be automatically pre-filled, streamlining their scheduling experience.

## Existing Features

### Patient Document Upload
Patients continue to have the capability to upload necessary documents, such as physician orders, directly within Blume. Uploaded documents remain readily accessible to imaging centers for prompt review.

### Integrated Patient Forms
Imaging centers retain the capability to enable specific forms for patients to complete during the appointment request process, ensuring comprehensive and accurate information gathering.
