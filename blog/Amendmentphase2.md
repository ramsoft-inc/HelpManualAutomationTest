# 🆕 Amendment Phase-2  

We are excited to announce the launch of enhaced feature **Improved Report Amendment Workflow**, powerful improvements to make the amendment process more structured and user-friendly.

## 🔹 What is it?  
This updated workflow introduces a safer, role-based workflow where all amendments are made on a copy of the signed report, with auto-inserted addendum tags and clear approval flow between users. ✅📝

💡**Key Highlights**:

**🏷️ Addendum Tags Auto-Inserted**:

Every amendment now comes with ➕ Addendum Start and ➖ Addendum End tags added automatically.
No manual effort needed!


**📄 Amendment on Copy, Not Original**:

Instead of editing the final report directly, a copy of the final will be used for amendment. Ensures audit safety and original report integrity.


**👥 Role-Based Amendment Control**:

Reading Physician: Can amend directly.

Non-Reading Physician: Can request amendment.

Report Owner: Can Accept ✅ or Reject ❌ the amendment request.


**🔄 Status Transitions**:

Starting Amendment: Signed ➝ To Be Amended

After Signing Amendment: To Be Amended ➝ Signed (or ➝ Amended if custom workflow is applied)
