# Overview: Implementing Time-Based Access Policies in OmegaAI

To enhance the security of OmegaAI, you can use Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to implement time-based access policies. This feature allows you to restrict user access to OmegaAI during designated office hours, ensuring users cannot log in outside of specified times. This approach helps maintain system security and control over when users can access critical applications.

Additionally, OmegaAI supports B2B federation, a feature that allows secure collaboration with external partners. B2B federation enables users from partner organizations to securely access OmegaAI using their own credentials. Once B2B federation is set up, partner organizations can manage time-based security policies independently through their own Azure AD environment.

## Steps to Set Up Time-Based Access in Azure AD

### Step 1: Integrate Your Organization with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

Before configuring time-based access, ensure that your organization is integrated with Azure AD. Azure AD provides the necessary tools, such as Conditional Access policies, for managing user access based on time, location, and other criteria. Make sure that all user accounts are synchronized and managed through Azure AD.

### Step 2: Define a Time-Based Access Policy in Azure AD

Azure AD’s Conditional Access feature allows you to define access policies based on various conditions, including time restrictions. Follow these steps to configure a time-based access policy:

1. **Access Azure AD Conditional Access**:
   - Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to **Azure Active Directory**.
   - Select **Security**, then choose **Conditional Access**.

2. **Create a New Policy**:
   - Click **New Policy** and assign it a relevant name (e.g., "Office Hours Access Policy").
   - Under **Assignments**, select **Users or Workloads** and choose the user groups to which the policy will apply (e.g., "Internal Staff" or "Customer X Users").

3. **Set the Conditions**:
   - Under **Conditions**, you can configure various parameters such as **Sign-in risk**, **Device platforms**, or **Locations** depending on your security needs.
   - For time-based access control, under **Sign-in frequency**, specify the times during which users can access the system. For example, restrict access to office hours (e.g., 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays).

4. **Configure Session Controls**:
   - Under **Grant**, specify actions that users can perform during the allowed hours. For example, allow login only during specified times and configure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security during office hours.

5. **Apply and Monitor the Policy**:
   - After configuring the policy, save and enable it. Azure AD will enforce the access restrictions automatically based on the specified conditions. You can monitor the policy’s effectiveness and user compliance through the Azure portal.
