## Overview

Teaching Folder is designed for professionals in the healthcare and
academic space, particularly radiologists and doctors. It enables users

teaching/training, and organizational purposes.

**Other Functionalities**

Teaching Folder retains all the functionalities of the worklist,
including exporting, study count, and applying filters.

**Note:**

- When a folder is shared, all its subfolders are also shared.

- The studies saved in the folders are not duplicates; they are
  references to the studies on the main worklist. Any changes made to a
  study in the main worklist will reflect in the teaching folder.

- Once permissions (**Can view** or **Can edit**) are granted, they do
  not expire or have a time limit. They can be changed or revoked by the
  user who shared the folder.
