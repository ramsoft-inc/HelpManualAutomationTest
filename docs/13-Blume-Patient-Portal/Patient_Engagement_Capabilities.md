5.  Click on Change PIN.

    current PIN to reset new PIN."

7.  After entering the current 6-digit PIN, click Edit.

    PIN, please try again."

9.  You have three attempts to enter the correct PIN. If unsuccessful,

    unauthorized use. Try again later."

15. Click Done to return to the Security Page under the Settings tab.
    You can now navigate to other sections as needed.

When using Single Sign-On (SSO) methods like Gmail or Facebook, the system does not prompt users to set or change a PIN. The option of changing the PIN is not supported. 

This is because users are authenticated through their external accounts, which already have their security measures in place.

For users who sign in with methods other than SSO, where they provide all their details and set up a PIN during the signup process, the Change PIN option becomes 

available. In these cases, since the user has explicitly set a PIN for security, they will be able to change it later.

This distinction ensures that only users who initially set up a PIN will have the option to modify it. Users authenticated through third-party services will not encounter 

the Change PIN option because the system does not handle their PIN setup.

#### Who can change their PIN on Blume?

- The Change PIN option is only available to users who created a PIN
  during the signup process.

- This applies to users who registered by manually entering their
  details and setting up a PIN, rather than using SSO.

- Since they explicitly set a PIN for security, they can modify it later.

- Users authenticated through third-party services (SSO) will not see
  the Change PIN option because their authentication is managed
  externally.

  **Note**: This distinction ensures that only users who initially set up a PIN within Blume can change it, maintaining security for all users.
