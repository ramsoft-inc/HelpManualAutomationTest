# Data Customization in Root Analytics

## Overview

Data customization is a pivotal feature in Root Analytics that enhances
the process of report creation by allowing you to fine-tune your visuals
according to specific analytical requirements. This guide outlines how
to effectively use various data customization tools to filter, limit,
and sort your data, thereby enabling more targeted and meaningful
analysis.

## Components 

- **Field Filter**: Apply filters to your visuals based on any data
  field available in Root, such as modality, to narrow down your
  analysis to relevant criteria.

- **Top N Filter**: Limit the number of rows or data points in a visual
  to focus exclusively on top-performing or most pertinent entries.

- **Group by Time**: Organize data by specific time periods (today,
  yesterday, this month, last year) and intervals (years, months, weeks)
  to track and analyze trends over time.

- **Sort Function**: Arrange your data in ascending or descending order
  based on selected fields to aid in clearer data interpretation.

## Step-by-Step Usage Guide

1.  **Applying Field Filters**:

    - Access the field filter customization within your visual settings.

    - Select the data field you wish to filter by, such as 'Modality'.

    - Apply the filter to isolate data that meets your specific
      criteria.

    - Refer to the "Report Filter" page for additional filtering options
      and details.

2.  **Using the Top N Filter**:

    - Navigate to the Top N filter option within your visual's
      customization settings.

    - Choose the number of data points to display, such as the top 10
      referring physicians.

    - The visual will automatically update to only show the selected top
      entries.

3.  **Grouping Data by Time**:

    - Locate the 'Group by Time' function in the customization menu.

    - Select a relative time period for analysis, such as 'this month'
      or 'last year'.

    - Choose the time interval for grouping, such as years, months, or
      weeks.

    - The visual will adjust to display data trends according to the
      chosen time frame.

4.  **Sorting Data**:

    - Access the sort option within the visual customization tools.

    - Select the field you wish to sort by and determine whether the
      sort order should be ascending or descending.

    - Your data will be reorganized based on your specified preferences,
      making it easier to interpret.
