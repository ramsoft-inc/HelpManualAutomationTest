# Form Bookmark

The Form Bookmark feature in OmegaAI allows users to save time and increase efficiency by auto-filling information that is commonly repeated across forms. This feature is especially useful for doctors or medical practitioners, who frequently need to fill out forms.

## Creating and Using Form Bookmarks

1. **Accessing Form Templates**: Navigate to form templates. For example, if you have forms under 'Patient Forms', proceed to that section.

2. **Bookmark Section**: Within the form template, you find the bookmark section. Here, you can bookmark specific fields that you often need to fill out.

3. **Drag and Drop**: Drag the required fields from the list of available data and drop them into your form template. A placeholder for the bookmarked data will appear in 
    the form.

4. **Selecting Priority Patient**: You can set a priority patient for whom the form is auto-filled.

5. **Creating Templates**: After adding all necessary bookmarks, create the template. This template will be used to populate the data already available in our system each 
    time you fill out a form for the priority patient.

6. **Filling Out the Form**: When you open a form to fill it out, the system will use the template to populate the data already available in the system.

    **Note**: The system will auto-fill fields such as patient's name, last name, health card number, study date etc. as per what appears in the Worklist. You just need to 
     fill out the fields that are not available in the system.

## Managing System-Filled Data

1. **No Modification Allowed**: The data filled by the system cannot be changed or edited within the form. For example, if the form is populated with the name of the      
    technician who performed a study, you cannot change this name within the form.

2. **Changing System Data**: If you need to change the data filled by the system, you need to do it within the system, not in the form. 

    For example, if you need to change the referring physician's name, you have to make the change within the system. This change is reflected in all forms.

    By using the Form Bookmark feature, practitioners save time and avoid the redundancy of entering the same information repeatedly.
