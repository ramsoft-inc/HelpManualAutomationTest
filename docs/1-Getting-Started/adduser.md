## Adding Users & Roles

After setting up or modifying an organization in OmegaAI, it is important to manage users by adding individuals and assigning them specific roles and responsibilities within the organization.

### Accessing User Management Features

**Edit Organization**:

Begin by navigating to the organization detail page. Click the 'Edit' option in the top right corner to enter edit mode.

 **Navigation Tabs**: Upon entering edit mode, several new tabs will appear on the left, including **General**, **Users and Roles**, **Organization Forms**, **Workflow Automation**, **Devices**, and **RIS Settings**. The presence of the **General** tab indicates you are on the correct page for editing.

    deactivate a user temporarily or permanently.

    - **Contact Information**: Provide email, phone, and fax. You can
      enter multiple contacts for each type.

    images or document viewers. Contact RAM software was used for the
    setup assistance.

6.  **Assigning Organization and Role**:

    - **Organization Tab**: This is pre-filled with your current
      organization but can be changed if necessary.

    - **Role Selection**: Choose an appropriate role from predefined
      options available within the masterâ€™s organization.

    - **Multiple Organizations**: You have the option to add the user to
      more than one organization on this screen.

7.  **Finalizing Changes**:

    - **Save**: Click 'Save' to confirm all the entered details and add
      the user to the system.

    - **Cancel**: Click 'Cancel' if you wish to exit without saving any
      changes.

**Note**: Effective user management in OmegaAI is essential for
maintaining structured access and defining responsibilities in
healthcare environments. Each user's role and access privileges were
carefully calibrated to ensure operational efficiency and security.
