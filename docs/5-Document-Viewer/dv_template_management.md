## Creating and Publishing Templates

1.  **Upload or Create:**

    - Decide whether to upload a predefined template or create a new one
      from scratch based on your specific needs.

2.  **Blank Template:**

    - Choose a blank template as a starting point, which includes
      predefined header and footer areas. Customize the body text
      section as required for your document structure.

3.  **Bookmark Integration:**

    - Integrate bookmarks by pressing the hash key (#) or clicking the
      bookmark icon to add placeholders directly into the template.

    - Use drag and drop to position bookmarks in the desired locations
      within the report, ensuring efficient data entry in future use.

    - Click the "Preview" button to see how the template appears with
      the current settings.

      orientation (portrait or landscape), to ensure the template meets
      the intended use case.

6.  **Publishing Process:**

    - Once the template is ready, click "Publish" to finalize it.

    - In the "Publish Template" drawer, enter details such as the
      template name, associated organization, modality, and other
      relevant information.

      for future documentation needs.
