# AI Transcription (Add-On Feature)

## AI Reporting with Radpair

The AI Transcriptionist Radpair, a key feature of OmegaAI, revolutionizes the reporting process for healthcare professionals, particularly in diagnostic radiology. Unlike traditional medical voice-to-text systems, Radpair does not require radiologists to dictate their reports in full. Instead, radiologists can casually mention key findings or highlights they want included in the report. Radpair processes this information, and leverages advanced AI to generate a professionally formatted report. It automatically compiles and lists diagnostic impressions based on the input provided.

## Accessing and Using the AI Transcriptionist

1.  **Enabling the Feature**:

    - The AI Transcriptionist feature is available once enabled for your
      user profile. When creating a new report, you will be
      automatically directed to the AI Transcriptionist user interface.

2.  **User Interface Orientation**:

    - At the top of the interface, you will find a study dropdown menu.
      This allows you to specify the type of study you are reporting on,
      or you can leave it empty for the system to auto-detect the study
      type based on your dictation.

    - Ensure the study type is correct before finalizing the report.

3.  **Dictation and Transcription**:

    - **Microphone Button**: Located on the left, this is where you
      dictate the findings. It functions similarly to traditional
      transcription dictation.

      ![AI](./img/a3.png)

- **Side-by-Side Option**: In the middle of the interface, this feature
  displays both your dictation and the final report simultaneously,
  allowing for real-time comparison and edits.

- **Final Report Area**: Positioned on the right, this area displays the
  completed report.

      'Process Report' to generate a fully formatted diagnostic
      radiology report.

### Reviewing and Finalizing the Report

1.  **Report Review Mode**:

    - In this mode, you can review the generated report and make any
      necessary edits using voice commands or manual text editing.

    - The 'Impression' section is auto-generated, but you have the
      flexibility to add, delete, or reorder lines as needed.

2.  **Signing and Editing the Report**:

    - After reviewing, you can finalize the report by clicking the
      'Sign' button located at the top right of the interface.

    - If further edits are needed or you wish to use OmegaAIΓÇÖs built-in
      report editor for final adjustments, click the dropdown icon next
      to 'Sign' and select **Approve and Edit Report**. This option is
      particularly useful for saving a preliminary report instead of
      directly signing it.
