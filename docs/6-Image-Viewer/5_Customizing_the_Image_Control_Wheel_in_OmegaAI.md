## Configuring Tools

1.  **Customize Tool Order and Visibility:**

    - Tools are listed and can be rearranged by dragging them up or down
      the list.

    - Hover the mouse over the left side of the tool's listing to reveal
      a number, click and hold to drag the tool.

    - Tools above the "Currently Not Assigned" line will appear on the
      Image Control Wheel.

    - If a tool above this line is not relevant to the current image,
      the next two available tools below the line will become
      accessible.

2.  **Assigning Hotkeys:**

    - Assign custom hotkeys to each tool by clicking on the tool and
      setting a key combination.

    - Acceptable formats include a single character, or combinations
      using Ctrl+Character or Shift+Character.

    - Avoid using hotkeys that conflict with common browser or operating
      system shortcuts.

- **Hotkeys**: 'S' (Windows/Mac)

- **Clinical Utility**: Crucial for viewing sequential images in
  modalities like MRI or CT.

**Window Level Tool**

- **Usage**: Adjusts brightness and contrast.

- **Operation**: Horizontal and vertical mouse movements adjust
  brightness and contrast, respectively.

- **Hotkeys**:  'W' (Windows/Mac)

- **Clinical Utility**: Optimizes image visualization to highlight
  different tissues or abnormalities.

**Crosshair Tool**

- **Usage**: Aligns identical anatomical points across different
  planes.

- **Hotkeys**: 'J' (Windows/Mac)

- **Clinical Utility**: Facilitates accurate cross-sectional studies in
  multi-planar imaging scenarios.

**Free Rotate**

- **Usage**: Rotates the image freely within the viewport.

- **Operation**: Click and drag to rotate; single click for preset
  angles.

- **Clinical Utility**: Useful for adjusting image orientation to
  standard anatomical positions.

**Zoom**

- **Usage**: Alters the scale of the image within the viewport.

- **Operation**: Right-click and drag to zoom.

- **Hotkeys**: 'Z' (Windows/Mac).

- **Clinical Utility**: Essential for examining details such as
  microcalcifications or fine tissue structures.

**Magnifier**

- **Usage**: Enlarges a specific area of the image.

- **Hotkeys**: 'M' (Windows/Mac).

- **Clinical Utility**: Enhances the visibility of small or subtle
  features within an image.

**Invert**

- **Usage**: Inverts the colours of the image.

- **Hotkeys**: ''\‚Äù (Windows/Mac)

  types by altering the contrast background.

**Shutter**

- **Usage**: Masks unwanted portions of the image.

- **Hotkeys**:  '' (Windows/Mac)

- **Clinical Utility**: Focuses the viewers attention on a specific
  part of the image by obscuring distractions.

**Quad Tool**

  anatomical correlation and interpretation.

## Markup Tools

**Length Measurement**

- **Usage**: Measures the distance between two points on the image.

- **Hotkeys**: 'D' (Windows/Mac).

- **Clinical Utility**: Utilized to measure anatomical structures or
  lesion sizes, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning.

**Angle Measurement**

- **Usage**: Calculates the angle between two intersecting lines.

- **Hotkeys**: 'A' (Windows/Mac).

- **Clinical Utility**: Important for orthopedic assessments, such as
  measuring angular deformities.

**Plumb Line**

- **Usage**: Draws a vertical reference line.

- **Hotkeys**: '\|' (pipe symbol, Windows/Mac).

- **Clinical Utility**: Assists in evaluating structural alignments,
  particularly in spinal imaging.

**ROI (Rectangular, Elliptical, Freehand)**
