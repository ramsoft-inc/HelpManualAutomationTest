# MPR Average Intensity Projection & Minimum Intensity Projections

## Overview

This section guide radiologists in using different intensity projection
options in the Image Viewer Module during PET/CT studies. These options
include Minimum Intensity Projection (MinIP), Average Intensity Projection (AveIP), and the default Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP).

## Selecting Intensity Projection Options

1.  Launch the Image Viewer Module and select the PET/CT study you would
    like to view.

2.  Navigate to the Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR) mode.

3.  Click on **Adjustments** option.

4.  A pop-up with three buttons will appear at the bottom:

    - MIP (Maximum Intensity Projection): This option will be selected by default.

    - MinIP (Minimum Intensity Projection)

    - AveIP (Average Intensity Projection)

5.  Click on your preferred projection method. The visual feedback in
    all three images will adjust accordingly.

> **Note**: These buttons will remain visible as long as you are in MPR
> mode. Once you exit MPR mode they will no longer be displayed.

## Understanding Intensity Projection Methods

- **Minimum Intensity Projection (MinIP)**: This method projects the
  voxel with the lowest attenuation value along each view throughout the
  volume onto a 2D image. It can highlight lower-attenuation structures
  and soft tissues.

- **Average Intensity Projection (AveIP)**: This method calculates the
  average attenuation value for each voxel along each view throughout
  the volume and represents it in a 2D image. It provides a balanced
  representation of attenuation values across the volume.

- **Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP)**: This is the default method and
  it projects the voxel with the highest attenuation value along each
  view throughout the volume onto a 2D image.

**Clinical Applications**

- **MinIP**: Useful for improving the detection and characterization of
  lesions and abnormalities, particularly in lower-attenuation
  structures and soft tissues.

- **AveIP**: Provides insights into tissue perfusion and the
  distribution of contrast material, offering a balanced representation
  of attenuation values across the volume.

- **MIP**: Offers a high-contrast view of high-attenuation structures,
  useful for identifying calcifications, nodules, and other
  abnormalities.
