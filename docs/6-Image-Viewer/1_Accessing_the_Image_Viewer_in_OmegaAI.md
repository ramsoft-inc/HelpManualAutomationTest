## Configuring Monitor Settings

OmegaAI allows customization of the display settings to enhance the
image viewing experience, especially useful in multi-monitor setups.

1.  **Single Monitor Mode:**

    - In this mode, the Image Viewer opens in the default monitor setup.

2.  **Multi-Monitor Mode:**

    - The Image Viewer can automatically open in full screen across
      multiple monitors. This setting is especially useful for detailed
      examinations of medical images.

3.  **Setting Full Screen Mode:**

    - By default, in a multi-monitor setup, the Image Viewer opens in
      full screen. If you are using a single monitor, you can also set
      the Image Viewer to open in full screen by adjusting the settings
      in your user profile.

### Adjusting Multi-Monitor Settings

To customize which monitors are used in the multi-monitor setup:

1.  **Navigate to User Settings:**

    - Click on the main navigation bar on the left side of the OmegaAI
      screen.

    - Select 'User Settings.'

2.  **Access Monitor Settings:**

    - Within the User Settings menu, click on 'Multi-Monitor Settings.'

    - Here, you can define which monitors should be utilized for
      displaying images.

3.  **Selecting Monitors:**

    - You can select any number of monitors that your hardware
      configuration supports. This flexibility allows for an optimized
      viewing environment tailored to your specific needs.
