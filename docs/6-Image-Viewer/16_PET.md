# PET-CT Fusion Mode

## Overview

PET-CT Fusion mode in OmegaAI is a specialized feature designed for
integrated imaging, allowing simultaneous visualization of PET (Positron
Emission Tomography) and CT (Computed Tomography) scans. This guide
details the activation process and functionalities of PET-CT Fusion
mode, focusing on its interface, navigation, and advanced visualization
options.

## Activation of PET-CT Fusion Mode

1.  **Starting Condition**: Ensure that two viewports are displayed side
    by side; one should display a PET image, and the other a CT image.

2.  **Triggering Fusion Mode**:

    - Look for the PET-CT Fusion activation option when both images are
      visible side by side.

    - Activate PET-CT Fusion mode by selecting this option, which
      typically appears in one of the viewports.

## Interface and Functionality

Upon activation, the screen layout adjusts to accommodate PET-CT Fusion:

- **Main Fusion Viewport**: Occupies half of the screen, displaying the
  fused image of PET and CT data. By default, this view is set to the
  axial mode, but can be switched to sagittal or coronal views via icons
  located at the top left of the viewport.

## Multi-Viewport Layout

- **Additional Views**: Alongside the main fusion viewport, up to four
  smaller viewports show various perspectives or standalone images,
  enhancing the analytical capabilities.

## Additional Options

- **Fusion View Adjustments**: Similar to NPR mode, tools for changing
  the slab thickness and rotating around the axis are available,
  ensuring precise and customizable visualization.
