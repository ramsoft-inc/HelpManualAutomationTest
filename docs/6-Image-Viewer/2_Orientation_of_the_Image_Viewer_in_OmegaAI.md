> **Viewports:**

- The main area of the Image Viewer where images are rendered.

- Each viewport displays overlay annotations, positional indicators, and
  key image indicators (if applicable).

- **Document Viewer Integration:** If the Document Viewer is open (side
  by side or another monitor), a 'grab' icon appears on the top left
  corner of viewport on mouse hover, allowing users to drag and drop
  images directly into reports.

> **Viewport Menu:**

- Located at the lower border of each viewport.

- Contains options like tile mode for multi-frame images, print, copy to
  clipboard, access to MPR (multiplanar reconstruction), PET-CT Fusion,
  CAT objects toggle, and a playback controller for cine imaging, all
  depending on the type of rendered image.

> **Scroll Bar:**

- Interactive and located on the right border of each viewport.

- Useful for navigating through multi-frame images. Hovering over the
  scroll bar displays the frame number.

> **Side-by-Side Document Review:**

- In single monitor mode, users have the option to view documents or
  create reports side-by-side with images, accessible from the lower
  left side of the viewport display area.
