# Document Review Mode

## Overview

Document Review Mode is a sophisticated feature of the OmegaAI Image
Viewer designed for efficient management and review of imaging study
documents. This feature is especially useful in single monitor setups
and is accessible through intuitive UI components. This guide provides
detailed instructions on how to navigate and utilize the various
functionalities within Document Review Mode.

## Accessing Document Review Mode

1.  **Initiate Document Review Mode**: Click on the document icon
    located at the lower right part of the image viewer interface. This
    action triggers the Document Review Mode.

    - If a final report has already been created for the study, the
      system will open this report.

    - If no final report is available, the system will select the most
      appropriate template for you to start a new report.
