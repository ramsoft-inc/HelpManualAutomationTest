# Introduction to OmegaAI Worklists

OmegaAI offers two primary types of worklists: **User Worklists** and
**Role Worklists**. These tools are designed to streamline the workflow
by organizing and displaying studies based on predefined or custom
filters that cater to the specific needs of the users or roles within
the organization.

## User Worklists vs. Role Worklists

- **User Worklists**: Customizable by individual users. You can create
  multiple worklists to manage different sets of data or tasks.

- **Role Worklists**: Created and assigned by admins to different roles
  within the organization. They are pre-configured and may have
  restrictions based on the role.
